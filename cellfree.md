#A cheaper cell-free expression system



## Background
While current protocols exist to express proteins using cell extract instead of whole, live cells, they tend to be very expensive, as they require high-energy phosphate compounds, as well as the addition of tRNA. This document consolidates several variants of these protocols which include:
- reduced preparation time
- reduced cost of reagents
- substantial (up to 1mg/ml) yield

*NB:* It remains to be tested on human proteins.
