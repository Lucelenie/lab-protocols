#A cheaper cell-free expression system



## Background
While current protocols exist to express proteins using cell extract instead of whole, live cells, they tend to be very expensive, as they require high-energy phosphate compounds, as well as the addition of tRNA. This document consolidates several variants of these protocols which include:
- reduced preparation time
- reduced cost of reagents
- substantial (up to 1mg/ml) yield

*NB:* It remains to be tested on human proteins.

## Protocol Preparation

The cell-free protocol described here requires several solutions:

### Buffer A

We currently have this buffer without the TCEP in the 4C refrigerator. It is filtered.

- 10mM Tris–acetate buffer (pH 8.2)
- 14 mM magnesium acetate
- 60 mM potassium glutamate
- 1mM TCEP

*NB:* TCEP has been substituted for the original protocol, which called for 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) containing 0.05% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME).

### Buffer B (Buffer A without TCEP)
- 10mM Tris–acetate buffer (pH 8.2),
- 14 mM magnesium acetate
- 60 mM potassium glutamate

*NB:* Original protocol called for 1mM DTT
